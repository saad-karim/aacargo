### Configuration ###

Supported Environment Variables:

`AABOT_BROWSER_REFRESH_INTERVAL` - This is the amount of time between browser refreshes. After a certain period
of time the cookies go stale and requests start to fail. By default, refreshes happend at every 15 seconds. This
can be adjusted using this environment variable. The interval is defined in seconds. For example, setting this
to 50 will trigger a browser refresh if 50 seconds have passed since the last refresh.

`AABOT_GUI_INTERVAL` - This is the amout of time of intentional delay between major GUI input. This delay exists
to allow for the previous GUI action to have taken effect, otherwise the next GUI interaction might fail. By default,
this interval is set to 0.05 seconds. The interval is defined in seconds. This can be adjusted to allow slower
machines more time process GUI events.

`AABOT_PRESERVE_CONSOLE_HISTORY` - If set to true, the console logs will not be deleted between request. This is
disabled by default to prevent the console log from getting infinitely big and consuming memory.
